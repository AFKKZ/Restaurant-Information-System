# Restaurant-Information-System
This project was created as the Final Project for Software Engineering course. In this project, the author was given the hypothetical case study of a restaurant called KTPham, which recently expanded from a capacity of about 50 people to approximately 150 people. The goal of this project was to create a new system for KTPham café/restaurant as the owner of KTPham has realized that the current manual system is not efficient enough.
